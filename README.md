<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation üìàüìä</h1>

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data to make predictions or decisions without requiring explicit programming. In this project, the implementation of machine learning algorithms is conducted using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which contains network traffic data, including various types of cyberattacks and normal activities.

This major project involves implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive-Bayes, and ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithms from scratch based on the following specifications:
- **KNN from scratch**:
  - Accepts at least two parameters: the number of neighbors and the distance metric.
  - Supports three types of distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski.
- **Gaussian Naive-Bayes from scratch**.
- **ID3 from scratch**, including the processing of numerical data as discussed in the course material.
